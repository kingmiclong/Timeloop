Title: The Time Loop Adventure Game

The Time Loop Adventure Game is an intriguing text-based interactive game that takes players on a unique journey through time and space. The game revolves around the concept of time looping, where the player finds themselves trapped in a room with four mysterious doors, each leading to a distinct path. The objective is to collect four crystals and escape the time loop, but the path to success is far from straightforward.

Each door presents its own set of adventures and challenges. As players venture into each path, they must make a series of decisions that will determine their fate. These decisions could lead to the discovery of a valuable crystal or, in some cases, death. In case of death, the game restarts and the player is forced to face the consequences of their past choices.

The beauty of the game is that death isn't the end. Instead, it's an opportunity to learn from past mistakes. Players remember their previous death events, helping them avoid making the same mistakes again. They also retain the crystals they've collected in their previous iterations, contributing to their progress in the game.

One of the intriguing features of the game is the 'Event Counter', a tool that keeps track of the total number of events the player has experienced. This counter provides players with a sense of progress and a record of their journey. The game also includes a 'Reset Game' button that clears the game's local storage and restarts the game afresh.

Moreover, the game employs clever mechanisms to maintain balance and suspense. For instance, once a player makes a choice, they must wait for three seconds before making another choice, adding a layer of anticipation to the gameplay. Also, to avoid repetition, once a player successfully navigates through a door and collects a crystal, that door becomes disabled, forcing the player to explore new paths.

The Time Loop Adventure Game is more than just a game; it's a captivating narrative that unfolds according to the player's decisions. It not only challenges the player's decision-making skills but also tests their memory and adaptability. With each playthrough being unique, this game promises a fresh and engaging experience every time.
